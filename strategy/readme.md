The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern used in object-oriented programming. It enables you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one of them, and make them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently from clients that use it.

The main components of the Strategy Pattern are:

1. Context: This is the class that has a reference to the strategy interface and is responsible for interacting with the strategies.

2. Strategy Interface: It defines a common interface for various concrete strategies. This interface represents the family of algorithms.

3. Concrete Strategies: These are the different implementations of the strategy interface.

check ```example.java```:

In this example, the ShoppingCart class is the context that allows the customer to choose different payment strategies (Credit Card or PayPal). The PaymentStrategy interface is implemented by the concrete strategy classes CreditCardPayment and PayPalPayment, each providing its own implementation of the pay method.

By changing the strategy at runtime using setPaymentStrategy, the context (ShoppingCart) can dynamically change its behavior without altering its structure, providing flexibility and allowing different payment methods to be used interchangeably.
