The Factory Design Pattern is a creational design pattern used in object-oriented programming. It's used to create objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client. This pattern involves a factory class responsible for creating objects of specific types based on certain inputs or conditions.

Here's a simple example of the Factory Design Pattern in Java:

Let's consider a scenario where you have a `Shape` interface and several concrete implementations like `Circle`, `Square`, and `Rectangle`.

```java
// Shape interface
interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

// Concrete implementations of Shape interface
class Circle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Circle");
    }
}

class Square implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Square");
    }
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    @Override
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("Drawing Rectangle");
    }
}

// Factory class to create objects of shapes
class ShapeFactory {
    public Shape createShape(String shapeType) {
        if (shapeType == null) {
            return null;
        }

        if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("CIRCLE")) {
            return new Circle();
        } else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("SQUARE")) {
            return new Square();
        } else if (shapeType.equalsIgnoreCase("RECTANGLE")) {
            return new Rectangle();
        }

        return null;
    }
}

// Usage of the factory to create shapes
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ShapeFactory shapeFactory = new ShapeFactory();

        // Create different shapes using the factory
        Shape circle = shapeFactory.createShape("CIRCLE");
        circle.draw(); // Output: Drawing Circle

        Shape square = shapeFactory.createShape("SQUARE");
        square.draw(); // Output: Drawing Square

        Shape rectangle = shapeFactory.createShape("RECTANGLE");
        rectangle.draw(); // Output: Drawing Rectangle
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The `Shape` interface defines the contract for different shapes.
- The concrete classes (`Circle`, `Square`, `Rectangle`) implement the `Shape` interface and provide their own specific implementation of the `draw` method.
- The `ShapeFactory` class provides a method to create different shapes based on the input passed to it.

The Factory Pattern encapsulates the object creation logic, providing a way to create objects without exposing the creation logic to the client. This helps in achieving loose coupling between classes and allows for easy extension in the future if new types of objects need to be added.
