The Memento Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides the ability to capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later. This pattern is used to implement the undo mechanism or to save and restore the state of an object without exposing its internal structure.

Key components of the Memento Pattern:

1. **Originator:** This is the object whose state needs to be saved. It creates and uses the memento to capture its internal state.

2. **Memento:** This is an object that stores the state of the originator. It has two main responsibilities: storing the state and providing the state to the originator when needed.

3. **Caretaker:** This is the object that keeps track of multiple mementos. It is responsible for storing and managing the history of the originator's state. The caretaker doesn't have access to the internal state of the memento.

Here's a simple example in Java to illustrate the Memento Pattern:

```java
// Memento class
class Memento {
    private String state;

    public Memento(String state) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    public String getState() {
        return state;
    }
}

// Originator class
class Originator {
    private String state;

    public void setState(String state) {
        this.state = state;
    }

    public String getState() {
        return state;
    }

    public Memento saveStateToMemento() {
        return new Memento(state);
    }

    public void restoreStateFromMemento(Memento memento) {
        this.state = memento.getState();
    }
}

// Caretaker class
class Caretaker {
    private Memento memento;

    public void setMemento(Memento memento) {
        this.memento = memento;
    }

    public Memento getMemento() {
        return memento;
    }
}

// Client code
public class MementoPatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Originator originator = new Originator();
        Caretaker caretaker = new Caretaker();

        // Setting and saving state
        originator.setState("State 1");
        caretaker.setMemento(originator.saveStateToMemento());

        // Changing state
        originator.setState("State 2");

        // Restoring state
        originator.restoreStateFromMemento(caretaker.getMemento());
        System.out.println("Current State: " + originator.getState());  // Output: Current State: State 1
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The `Memento` class stores the state of the `Originator` class.

- The `Originator` class has methods to set and get its state, as well as methods to save its state to a memento and restore its state from a memento.

- The `Caretaker` class is responsible for keeping track of multiple mementos. In this simple example, it only stores one memento.

- The client code demonstrates creating an `Originator`, changing its state, saving the state to a memento, changing the state again, and then restoring the state from the saved memento.

The Memento Pattern is useful when you need to capture and restore an object's internal state without exposing its details. It is often employed in scenarios where undo functionality or persistent state management is required.

### Real-world examples

Real-world examples of the Memento Design Pattern can be found in various applications where the ability to capture and restore an object's state is essential. Here are a few examples:

1. **Text Editors with Undo/Redo Functionality:**
   - Text editors often use the Memento Pattern to implement undo and redo functionality. Each time a user makes a change to the document, a memento is created to capture the current state. This allows users to undo or redo their actions by restoring the document's state to a previous point.

2. **Version Control Systems:**
   - Version control systems like Git utilize a similar concept to the Memento Pattern to track changes in source code. Commits act as mementos, capturing the state of the codebase at a specific point in time. Developers can revert to previous commits to restore the project to an earlier state.

3. **Graphics Software with History Panel:**
   - Graphics software often includes a history panel that allows users to navigate through previous states of a design. The Memento Pattern can be applied to save and restore the state of the canvas, including the position, properties, and transformations of each graphical element.

4. **Database Transactions:**
   - In database management systems, the Memento Pattern is used in the context of transactions. Before making changes to a database, a system might create a memento (transaction log) to capture the current state. If an error occurs during the transaction, the system can revert to the previous state by using the memento.

5. **E-commerce Shopping Cart:**
   - In an online shopping application, the state of a user's shopping cart can be captured using the Memento Pattern. For example, when a user adds items to the cart, a memento can be created to save the cart's state. If the user decides to undo or redo actions (add/remove items), the system can restore the shopping cart to a previous state.

6. **Game State Management:**
   - In video games, the Memento Pattern is commonly used for saving and loading game states. When a player reaches a checkpoint or completes a level, the game can create a memento to store the current state. If the player loses or wants to replay the level, the system can restore the game state from the saved memento.

7. **Configuration Management in Software:**
   - Configuration changes in software applications may involve modifying various settings. The Memento Pattern can be applied to capture the state of configuration settings before modifications. If there are issues or if the user wants to revert to previous settings, the system can restore the configuration from the memento.

In these examples, the Memento Pattern provides a mechanism for capturing and restoring the state of objects, contributing to features such as undo functionality, versioning, and managing changes over time.
