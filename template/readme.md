The Template Method Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. In other words, it provides a way to define the structure of an algorithm while allowing its steps to be implemented by subclasses.

Key components of the Template Method Pattern:

1. **Template:** This is an abstract class (or interface) that declares the skeleton of an algorithm. It defines the steps of the algorithm using abstract methods.

2. **ConcreteTemplate:** This is a concrete subclass of the template that provides specific implementations for the abstract methods. It customizes or overrides the steps of the algorithm.

Here's a simple example in Java to illustrate the Template Method Pattern:

```java
// Template class
abstract class AbstractAlgorithm {
    // Template method that defines the algorithm structure
    public final void executeAlgorithm() {
        stepOne();
        stepTwo();
        stepThree();
    }

    // Abstract methods to be implemented by subclasses
    protected abstract void stepOne();
    protected abstract void stepTwo();
    protected abstract void stepThree();
}

// ConcreteTemplate subclass
class ConcreteAlgorithm extends AbstractAlgorithm {
    @Override
    protected void stepOne() {
        System.out.println("ConcreteAlgorithm - Step One");
    }

    @Override
    protected void stepTwo() {
        System.out.println("ConcreteAlgorithm - Step Two");
    }

    @Override
    protected void stepThree() {
        System.out.println("ConcreteAlgorithm - Step Three");
    }
}

// Client code
public class TemplateMethodPatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AbstractAlgorithm algorithm = new ConcreteAlgorithm();
        algorithm.executeAlgorithm();
    }
}
```

In this example:

- `AbstractAlgorithm` is the template class that declares the template method `executeAlgorithm` along with abstract methods `stepOne`, `stepTwo`, and `stepThree`.

- `ConcreteAlgorithm` is a concrete subclass that extends `AbstractAlgorithm` and provides specific implementations for the abstract methods.

- The `main` method in the `TemplateMethodPatternExample` class demonstrates the usage of the template method by creating an instance of `ConcreteAlgorithm` and calling `executeAlgorithm`.

The Template Method Pattern is commonly used when you have an algorithm with steps that should be common across multiple subclasses, but some steps need to be customized in each subclass. It promotes code reuse and ensures that the algorithm's structure remains consistent across different implementations. It's often used in frameworks where the overall algorithm is defined, but certain details are expected to be provided by client code or concrete subclasses.
