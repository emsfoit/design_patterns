The Template Method Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. In other words, it provides a way to define the structure of an algorithm while allowing its steps to be implemented by subclasses.

Key components of the Template Method Pattern:

1. **Template:** This is an abstract class (or interface) that declares the skeleton of an algorithm. It defines the steps of the algorithm using abstract methods.

2. **ConcreteTemplate:** This is a concrete subclass of the template that provides specific implementations for the abstract methods. It customizes or overrides the steps of the algorithm.

Here's a simple example in Java to illustrate the Template Method Pattern:

```java
// Template class
abstract class AbstractAlgorithm {
    // Template method that defines the algorithm structure
    public final void executeAlgorithm() {
        stepOne();
        stepTwo();
        stepThree();
    }

    // Abstract methods to be implemented by subclasses
    protected abstract void stepOne();
    protected abstract void stepTwo();
    protected abstract void stepThree();
}

// ConcreteTemplate subclass
class ConcreteAlgorithm extends AbstractAlgorithm {
    @Override
    protected void stepOne() {
        System.out.println("ConcreteAlgorithm - Step One");
    }

    @Override
    protected void stepTwo() {
        System.out.println("ConcreteAlgorithm - Step Two");
    }

    @Override
    protected void stepThree() {
        System.out.println("ConcreteAlgorithm - Step Three");
    }
}

// Client code
public class TemplateMethodPatternExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AbstractAlgorithm algorithm = new ConcreteAlgorithm();
        algorithm.executeAlgorithm();
    }
}
```

In this example:

- `AbstractAlgorithm` is the template class that declares the template method `executeAlgorithm` along with abstract methods `stepOne`, `stepTwo`, and `stepThree`.

- `ConcreteAlgorithm` is a concrete subclass that extends `AbstractAlgorithm` and provides specific implementations for the abstract methods.

- The `main` method in the `TemplateMethodPatternExample` class demonstrates the usage of the template method by creating an instance of `ConcreteAlgorithm` and calling `executeAlgorithm`.

The Template Method Pattern is commonly used when you have an algorithm with steps that should be common across multiple subclasses, but some steps need to be customized in each subclass. It promotes code reuse and ensures that the algorithm's structure remains consistent across different implementations. It's often used in frameworks where the overall algorithm is defined, but certain details are expected to be provided by client code or concrete subclasses.

### Real World Examples:

The Template Method Design Pattern is used to define the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its structure. Here are some real-world examples where the Template Method Pattern is applicable:

1. **Beverage Preparation in Coffee Shops:**
   - In a coffee shop, the process of preparing a beverage (e.g., coffee, tea) follows a template.
   - The Template Method Pattern can be applied to define a generic method for preparing beverages, with specific steps overridden in subclasses to customize the preparation for different types of drinks.

2. **Meal Preparation in Cooking Recipes:**
   - Cooking recipes often have a standardized process with variations for different dishes.
   - The Template Method Pattern can be used to create a template for preparing meals, allowing specific recipes to override or extend certain steps while keeping a consistent overall structure.

3. **Document Generation in Word Processors:**
   - Word processors often have templates for document generation, such as letters or reports.
   - The Template Method Pattern can be applied to define a generic method for creating documents, with subclasses customizing specific sections or elements based on the document type.

4. **Automated Testing Frameworks:**
   - Automated testing frameworks often follow a common structure for test execution.
   - The Template Method Pattern can be used to define a generic testing algorithm, allowing individual test cases to override specific steps as needed, such as setup, execution, and cleanup.

5. **Game Development and Character AI:**
   - In game development, character AI may follow a standard decision-making process with variations for different characters.
   - The Template Method Pattern can be applied to define a generic AI algorithm, with individual characters providing their specific implementations for decision-making steps.

6. **Logging Frameworks in Software Development:**
   - Logging frameworks need to capture and record log entries consistently.
   - The Template Method Pattern can be used to define a generic logging algorithm, with subclasses providing specific implementations for formatting and handling different types of log entries.

7. **Online Order Processing in E-commerce:**
   - Online order processing involves common steps such as order validation, payment processing, and shipping.
   - The Template Method Pattern can be applied to define a standard order processing algorithm, allowing individual order types to customize specific steps.

8. **HTTP Servlets in Java Web Development:**
   - In Java web development, HTTP servlets follow a standard lifecycle with methods like `doGet` and `doPost`.
   - The Template Method Pattern is applied here, where the servlet class provides a template for handling HTTP requests, and subclasses override specific methods to implement custom behavior.

9. **Lifecycle Hooks in Component Frameworks:**
   - Component frameworks often have lifecycle hooks that are executed at specific points in the component's lifecycle.
   - The Template Method Pattern can be used to define a generic lifecycle algorithm, with subclasses providing specific implementations for hooks relevant to their components.

10. **Database Access in Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) Libraries:**
    - ORM libraries often have a standardized process for mapping objects to database tables.
    - The Template Method Pattern can be applied to define a generic object-relational mapping algorithm, allowing subclasses to customize specific steps for mapping different types of objects.

In these examples, the Template Method Pattern provides a way to define a common algorithmic structure in a superclass while allowing subclasses to tailor certain steps to their specific requirements. This promotes code reuse and consistency in the implementation of related processes.
